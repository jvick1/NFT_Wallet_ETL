## 00_FF_Wallets 
pulls all the token addresses and finds wallets

## 02_Wallet_Data_Summary 
combines the files and counts how many frogs each wallet has

## 03_Last_Tx
last tx

## 04_Dead_Wallet
pulls any missed tx & finds dead wallets based on t

## 05_EDA
look at data

## Next Steps
06_ use the Solscan_API code to create a way to get a full dataset of every frog, every wallet, attributes, last sold, etc.

07_ use the Burn_of_the_week code to track if there are any new blends if there is remove that frog from database & find delta (the frog he was burned with)

08_ watch for faction updates/ weapon blends/ etc.

I want to get data set then only update the deltas.
not having to re-run 00-02 all the time.
